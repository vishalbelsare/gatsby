See the [Gatsby CHANGELOG.md](./packages/gatsby/CHANGELOG.md)

Gatsby is distributed as a [monorepo][monorepo] using [lerna][lerna].

This means that our `CHANGELOG.md` files are distributed alongside the package itself in the `packages` directory.

For example, the package `gatsby` has a `CHANGELOG.md` in [`packages/gatsby/CHANGELOG.md`](./packages/gatsby/CHANGELOG.md). If you'd like to check out others, check out the [`packages`](./packages) directory in the root of the repo.
