[Incremental Builds](/blog/2020-04-22-announcing-incremental-builds/) helps build your site faster. The [Slice API](/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-slice) pushes your build speeds even further for common UI components. Learn how to use the Slice API in our [How-to doc](/docs/how-to/performance/using-slices).

By knowing which pieces of your site to build and host, Gatsby Cloud can increase build times on Slice changes by up to 90%.
