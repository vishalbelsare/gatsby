Gatsby Cloud provides integrations for many popular hosting and content management platforms that help make development with Gatsby even more efficient.

## Hosting integrations

Hosting integrations simplify deploying your site to the internet. The following hosting services are officially supported and have automated integrations:

- Azure
- Amazon Web Services S3
- Fastly
- Firebase
- Google Storage
- Netlify
- Vercel

When you set up a hosting integration, your site will automatically be deployed to your chosen service any time a Production Build completes successfully.

## Data source integrations

Data source integrations make it easy to connect your site to a content management system (CMS). The following CMS providers are officially supported and can be automatically configured with [Quick Connect](/docs/reference/cloud/quick-connect):

- Contentful
- Cosmic
- DatoCMS
- Sanity

The following CMS providers are also officially supported but require manual configuration:

- Agility
- Contentstack
- Drupal
- Flotiq
- Kontent
- Strapi
- WordPress

Depending on the configuration, whenever you make updates in your CMS, you can automatically trigger Production Builds and CMS Previews for your site.

For details on how to set up a hosting or data source integration, see our [How-To Guides](/docs/how-to/cloud/).
