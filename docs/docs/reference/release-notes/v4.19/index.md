## Gatsby Head API

Gatsby now includes a built-in `Head` export that allows you to add elements to the [document head](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) of your pages.

Compared to [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) or other similar solutions, Gatsby Head is easier to use, more performant, has a smaller bundle size, and supports the latest React features. **You no longer need a third-party library to handle meta tags in Gatsby.** Gatsby Head also automatically places your meta tags into the generated HTML so you also no longer need a Gatsby plugin in your `gatsby-config.js`.

```jsx:title=src/pages/index.jsx
import * as React from "react"

const Page = () => <div>Hello World</div>
export default Page

export function Head() {
  return (
    <title>Hello World</title>
  )
}
```

The `Head` function has to return valid JSX which also means that you can use React's composition model and define a reusable React component to more easily handle default values for your pages. You can learn more about this in the [Adding an SEO component guide](/docs/how-to/adding-common-features/adding-seo-component).

One thing to note is that every page that need to add some tags to document head needs to export or re-export a Head function. You may only do a re-export if the new page needs to have same tags as the previous.

One important difference between Gatsby Head API and solutions like `react-helmet` is that (at the moment) you lose the ability to define global defaults (e.g. in a layout component) and have them automatically applied everywhere. With Gatsby Head API your pages have to export a `Head` function to define meta tags for this specific page. To help with that you can use an SEO component or re-export the `Head` function from somewhere else:

```jsx:title=src/pages/index.jsx
import * as React from "react"

const Page = () => <div>Hello World</div>
export default Page

// highlight-next-line
export { Head } from "../another/location"
```

For full details, see the [Gatsby Head API reference guide](/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-head/). To learn how to use Gatsby Head API with TypeScript, head to the [TypeScript and Gatsby guide](/docs/how-to/custom-configuration/typescript/#headprops).

This feature followed our RFC process, you can read [RFC: Gatsby Head API](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/35841) to understand how the API was created.

## Release Candidate for `gatsby-plugin-mdx` v4

In case you missed it: We're working on a new major version of `gatsby-plugin-mdx` to support MDX v2, improve build & frontend performance, and simplify the API.

You can now try out a release candidate version, head to the [MDX v2 RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/25068) to learn more.
