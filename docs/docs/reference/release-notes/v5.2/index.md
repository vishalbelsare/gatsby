Welcome to `gatsby@5.2.0` release (November 2022 #3)

This is an out of band release due to the [removal of the Potrace](#removal-of-potrace) library in Gatsby. We'll continue with our biweekly schedule as normal.

Also check out [notable bugfixes](#notable-bugfixes--improvements).

**Bleeding Edge:** Want to try new features as soon as possible? Install `gatsby@next` and let us know if you have any [issues](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues).

## Removal of Potrace

Due to licensing requirements, we are removing the [Potrace library](https://potrace.sourceforge.net/) usage from Gatsby. Potrace is used in Gatsby's image transformations, specifically for creating a SVG placeholder. For example, in `gatsby-plugin-image` you were able to use it with `tracedSvg` and `TRACED_SVG` respectively.

These are the affected libraries/plugins:

- gatsby-plugin-sharp
- gatsby-transformer-sharp
- gatsby-plugin-utils
- gatsby-remark-images

There will be **no API-breaking changes**, your builds will continue to work. However, whenever you use the `tracedSvg` feature Gatsby automatically falls back to the default placeholder style now. In most instances this is `DOMINANT_COLOR`. You'll see a detailed warning message in your CLI about this, too.

If youâ€™d like to know more or have any questions, head over to our [Github Discussion](https://gatsby.dev/tracesvg-removal).

## Notable bugfixes & improvements

- `gatsby-source-wordpress`: `MediaItem.excludeFieldNames` / auto exclude interface types that have no fields, via [PR #37062](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/37062)
- `gatsby-source-drupal`: Provide `proxyUrl` in addition to baseUrl to allow using CDN, API gateway, etc., via [PR #36819](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/36819)
- `gatsby-cli`: We changed our error messages a little bit. You should see a more detailed `type` beside the error ID now
- `gatsby`: Sanitize `length` on objects, via [PR #34253](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/34253)
