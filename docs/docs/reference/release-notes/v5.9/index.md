## Performance improvements

We have shipped some great performance improvements to `gatsby` and `gatsby-source-contentful`.

- With [PR #37780](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/37780) we no longer block the event loop during [schema inference](/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/#automatic-type-inference) and allow garbage collection to work better. This dropped the "building schema" step of a large test site by 27%.
- In [PR #37782](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/37782) we've added a new public action called [`enableStatefulSourceNodes`](/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#enableStatefulSourceNodes). This will stop Gatsby from checking for stale nodes created by the source plugin that called the action. When enabling stateful sourcing plugin authors need to be sure their plugins properly handle deleting nodes when they need to be deleted. Since Gatsby is no longer checking for node staleness, data which should no longer exist could stick around. Be sure to read the [opting out of stale node deletion](/docs/node-creation/#opting-out-of-stale-node-deletion) documentation.
- Lastly, in [PR #37910](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/37910) the memory usage of `gatsby-source-contentful` was further decreased. This was achieved by further unblocking the event loop through a queue, allowing more garbage collection, and an improved way of storing intermediate information for backreferences.

All in all these improvements enabled a Contentful test site of ours (with 4.9 million nodes) to build with 24GB of RAM (instead of 64GB), 27% decrease in "building schema" step, and around 70% faster data updates.

## New "Creating a Source Plugin" tutorial

A new tutorial for [Creating a Source Plugin from scratch](/docs/tutorial/creating-a-source-plugin/) is available now!

Gatsbyâ€™s data layer is one of the key features and an enabler for composable architectures. One of the key driving forces of Gatsby since its beginning has been its [800+ source plugins](/plugins?=gatsby-source-). These plugins make it easy to connect and source from every data source you could imagine.

While our documentation always had a guide on how to create a source plugin, the content was dense and at times difficult to follow. It didnâ€™t show how easy it is to create a barebones source plugin and how many additional features you could add. We wanted to make it easier for users and customers alike to create their own source plugins.
